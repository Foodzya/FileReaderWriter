Hello! This is FileReaderWriter Application made by Alexander B.

This console application supports multiple file formats read/write operations and aggregate operations over the content of these file types.

Supported file formats are: .txt (plain text), .rtxt (reversed text), .etxt (encrypted text using caesar cipher) and .btxt (plain text as binary).

Almost all menu movements are executed by pressing a button once.

Main menu:
1. By pressing 1 you'll move to the READ MENU which is responsible for reading files with specific formats (which I mentioned above).
In read menu you'll have to specify absolute path to the file which you would like to read the text from. If the file exists by your path, you will move to the appropriate menu based on the file extension. If not, you will be returned to the READ MENU. Also you are able to return to the previous menu by pressing 2.
2. By presson 2 you'll move to the WRITE MENU which is responsible for reading text from console or text file (.txt) and formatting this text according to the extension of the file where you want to write the final text. If you will specify wrong path to the file which you'd like to write text in, then you will be able to type path once again or return back to the previous menu.
3. By pressing 3 you'll quit the application.
